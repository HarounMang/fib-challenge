# Challenge â€“ Even Fibonacci numbers

In fib.py is my attempt at solving the even Bibonacci number challenge. That is, by considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million,
find the sum of the even-valued terms. 

The way I solved this is by noticing that only that eeach third number in the Fibonacci number is an even number. The is the 3th, 6th, 9th, etc. are only even numbers in the Fibonacci sequence (starting from 0). Then the fibonacci number is calculated using a dynamic programming approach.

To run the code:
1. Clone the repository
2. Open a terminal
3. Make sure to cd to the correct folder
4. Run the file by typing either 'python fib.py' or 'python3 fib.py' in your terminal
